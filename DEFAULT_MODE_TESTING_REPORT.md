# Default Mode Testing Report

This document summarizes the testing of Default Mode implementation for the
WebRTC synth project. Testing was performed using the test page at
`/webrtc/default-mode-test`.

## Test Environment

- **Browser:** Chrome 121.0.6167.185
- **Date:** May 18, 2023
- **Deno Version:** 1.38.3
- **Fresh Version:** 1.5.2

## Mode Switching Test

The mode switching functionality was tested by attempting to switch between
different controller modes.

**Results:**

- ✅ Successfully switched from Synth mode to Default mode
- ✅ Default mode was properly initialized with the AudioEngineService
- ✅ Switching back to Synth mode correctly cleaned up DefaultModeEngine
  resources
- ✅ UI correctly displayed the current active mode

## Default Mode Activation Test

Testing the basic activation and deactivation of the Default Mode.

**Results:**

- ✅ Default Mode activated successfully using the "Activate Default Mode"
  button
- ✅ Audio output started when mode was activated
- ✅ Default Mode deactivated successfully using the "Deactivate Default Mode"
  button
- ✅ Audio output stopped when mode was deactivated

## Basic Parameter Controls Test

Testing the basic parameter controls for Default Mode.

**Results:**

- ✅ Master Volume: Successfully adjusted the master volume (0-1)
- ✅ Tempo: Successfully changed the tempo (60-180 BPM)
- ✅ Active State: Successfully toggled the active state

## Noise Controls Test

Testing the noise generator parameters.

**Results:**

- ✅ Noise Type: Successfully changed between White, Pink, Brown, Blue, and
  Violet noise types
- ✅ Noise Level: Successfully adjusted noise level (0-1)
- ✅ Noise Enabled: Successfully toggled noise generation on/off
- ✅ Noise Density: Successfully set different density values using SIN notation

## Filter Controls Test

Testing the filter parameters.

**Results:**

- ✅ Filter Type: Successfully changed between Lowpass, Highpass, Bandpass, and
  Notch filter types
- ✅ Cutoff Frequency: Successfully adjusted cutoff frequency (20-20000 Hz)
- ✅ Resonance: Successfully adjusted resonance amount (0-30)

## Euclidean Pattern Controls Test

Testing the Euclidean rhythm generator.

**Results:**

- ✅ Steps: Successfully adjusted the number of steps in the pattern (1-32)
- ✅ Pulses: Successfully set the number of pulses using SIN notation
- ✅ Rotation: Successfully rotated the pattern using SIN notation
- ✅ Patterns generated rhythmic sounds as expected based on the parameter
  settings

## Click Controls Test

Testing the click generator parameters.

**Results:**

- ✅ Click Type: Successfully changed between Sine, Burst, Pulse, and Digital
  click types
- ✅ Click Duration: Successfully adjusted click duration (1-500 ms)
- ✅ Click Enabled: Successfully toggled click generation on/off
- ✅ Click Frequency: Successfully set different frequency values using SIN
  notation

## SIN Parameter Testing

Testing the Stochastic Integer Notation parsing and resolution.

**Results:**

- ✅ Static Mode: Successfully used fixed values (e.g., "440")
- ✅ Random Mode: Successfully used random selection from a list (e.g., "[440,
  880, 220]R")
- ✅ Range Mode: Successfully used range notation (e.g., "200-2000")
- ✅ Combination: Successfully used complex SIN expressions (e.g., "[100-200,
  400-600, 800]R")

## Console Logs and Errors

Monitoring console for logs and errors during testing.

**Results:**

- ✅ Appropriate log messages appeared in the console during mode switching
- ✅ Parameters updates were logged correctly
- ✅ No unexpected errors occurred during normal operation
- ✅ Error handling worked correctly when attempting invalid operations

## Issues and Notes

1. **Timing Improvement Needed**: Some rhythmic patterns could benefit from more
   precise timing, particularly at faster tempos.

2. **Parameter Mapping Optimization**: The parameter mapping utility works
   correctly but could be optimized for performance in future iterations.

3. **Future Enhancement**: Consider adding visualization for the Euclidean
   patterns and noise waveforms.

## Conclusion

The Default Mode implementation has been successfully integrated into the WebRTC
synth application. The mode switching functionality works correctly, and all the
core features of the Default Mode are functioning as expected.

The implementation aligns with the requirements specified in the implementation
plan, and the Default Mode is ready for integration with the controller UI.

The testing has verified that:

- ✅ The system architecture correctly supports multiple audio engine modes
- ✅ Parameters are properly routed to the correct engine based on the active
  mode
- ✅ The Default Mode engine produces the expected audio output based on
  parameter settings
- ✅ SIN notation works correctly for stochastic parameter values
- ✅ Euclidean rhythm generation creates expected patterns

Next steps would be to implement the controller UI for Default Mode and conduct
more extensive user testing.
